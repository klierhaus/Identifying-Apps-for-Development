    "\n",
    "In this hypothetical scenario, I will be working as a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and my job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build. The aim is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets.\n",

    "At my company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads.

There seems to be promise around the Bible - and combining it with 'Books' could be a winner. We could develop an app giving spiritual quotes every day, 'Bible for Children' app where main stories are shortened accompanied with illustrations, or perhaps a social network or people who would like to study the Bible together.\n",

It may also require us to connect our apps to non-free live weather data APIs.\n",
